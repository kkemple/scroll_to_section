# Scroll To Section

This module allows you to easily attach it to any object other than the window and with it you can easily add scroll to section functionality to your web page with out having to use it as a jQuery plugin (It is jQuery based, just not a jQuery plugin which makes it more modular by being able to attach it to a ui namespace)

## Documentation
Documentation on this module will be available soon...
